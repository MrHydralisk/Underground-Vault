# Underground Vault

![Text](/Mod%20Page/Images/Underground%20Vault.png)

If you have giant colony and have a lot of items, that not needed at that moment or any time soon, but might be needed later, while normal and deep storage is not enough for you, then this mod will help you by storing things safely deep underground.

## Mod Contents

Mod adding new buildings Vault Terminals, that allowing your pawns to operate Underground Vaults under them. Vaults provide a big storage space, that safely hidden from any raiders activity. The disadvantage of Vault is that it takes long time to bring items from Vault to the surface for pawns usage afterwards. 

Vaults located deep underground, which doesn't allow raiders to know about their existence (items inside not counted as part of colony wealth). 
Destruction of Vaults from outside is highly unlikely, even if Vault Terminal destroyed. But Vault can be manually detonated via button, in case you want to free space or move vault. All items in Vault will be lost after detonation. 

Vault Terminals can be upgraded with additional modules.
Vault can be expanded by constructing new floors or upgrading existing ones, which takes time and resources in Vault or Terminal platform or delivered by Pawns with delivery job.
